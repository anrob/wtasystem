        <em><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">For my wedding 11 years ago I had one of the top photographers in the business, everybody wanted this guy and I was so excited to be able to get him for my wedding. There was only one problem- His work was amazing but truthfully, he was a jerk. He was very arrogant and I figured &quot;well, that&#39;s just the downside of dealing with an artist, as long as my pictures look great I can deal with it&quot;.&nbsp;Seemed like a good idea at the time but looking back it was a huge mistake. When I look at my wedding album now I love the framing, lighting, posing and the look of my images but I&#39;m not happy in the pictures and all I see is my strained smile from being so annoyed at being ordered around by my jerk of a photographer all day.&nbsp;Seeing samples of your photographer&#39;s work to get an idea of what he will do at your wedding is critical but don&#39;t forget that you will be spending the entire day with this person, being poked and prodded and posed and pushed in every direction to get just the right shots so you better make sure you can get along with them!&nbsp;</span></span></span></em></p>
    <p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
        <em><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Getting the best pictures is not just about a photographer&#39;s skill in posing, framing and lighting it is also about bringing out the best in you which is best done when his personality matches your own. After 8 hours with my photographer I was ready to strangle him. The best albums show the glow and the excitement of your wedding day and how happy you are to spend it with close friends whom you love, but with the exception of your fianc&eacute;e the only person who will be by your side the entire day will be your photographer so you better make sure you can get along with him/her.</span></span></span></em><br />
